# Coin-Thief

Coin Thief is a Python game that uses only default modules and runs entirely in the console. Due to several of the modules used, it will only run in Windows. The object is to move around a procedurally generated playing area to collect coins and increase your score while avoiding the enemy.

About
===
This is my first attempt making a game in Python. It is inspired 
by a very basic game I made on my TI-83+ using TI-BASIC back in
2001. It is the realized version of a project started long ago!

The design goal is to keep the game on the more basic side by 
only using default modules and only using the command line to 
display. It will only run on Windows however, due to some of the 
default modules being used.

High Score File
===
[high_score.ini](high_score.ini)

The game will automatically create the high_score.ini file in the same 
directory if it does not already exist so there should be no need to 
download/copy the file included in the repository. However, just to 
demonstrate the file that is generated, I have included a default 
version. The values start at 0 and each setting is tracked separately. 
As you gain new high scores for each setting, the .ini will be updated. 

Road Map
===
This game is effectively finished. However, as it was my first "major" 
Python project, the code can be quite messy in places :) In the future 
I would like to clean up parts of the code to make it more optimized 
and at that point I will publish it as a 2.0 final, with a very small 
possibility of little features or bugfixes here or there.
