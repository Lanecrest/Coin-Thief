# Coin Thief

Coin Thief is a Python game that uses only default modules and runs entirely in the console. Due to several of the modules used, it will only run in Windows. The object is to move around a procedurally generated playing area to collect coins and increase your score while avoiding the enemy.

# About
This is my first attempt at making a game in Python. It is inspired 
by a very basic game I made on my TI-83+ using TI-BASIC back in
2001. It is the realized version of a project started long ago!

The design goal is to keep the game on the more basic side by 
only using default modules and only using the console to 
display and keyboard for inputs.

# Requirements
There are no non-default modules used that don't come with a typical 
Python installation on Windows, which is one of the design goals. 
However, that means the game will only run correctly on Windows.

# Other Files
High Score File
-
The game will automatically create the [high_score.ini](high_score.ini) 
file in the same directory if it does not already exist so there should 
be no need to download/copy the file included in the repository. 
However, to demonstrate the file that is generated, I have included the 
default version. The values start at 0 and each setting is tracked 
separately. As you gain new high scores for each setting, the .ini 
will be updated. 

# Road Map
This game is functional as is with cohesive gameplay, but as my first 
attempt at a more complex project, the code is sloppy in place and 
uses what I know now are some bad habits. In the future I would like 
to recode some parts but this would effectively be all back-end and 
add no real new functionality to the game.
