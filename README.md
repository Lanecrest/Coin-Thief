About
===
This is my first attempt making a game in Python. It is inspired 
by a very basic game I made on my TI-83+ using TI-BASIC back in
2001. It is the realized version of a project started long ago!

The design goal is to keep the game on the more basic side by 
only using default modules and only using the command line to 
display. It will only run on Windows however, due to some of the 
default modules being used.

High Score File
===
[high_score.ini](high_score.ini)

The game will automatically create the high_score.ini file in the same 
directory if it does not already exist so there should be no need to 
download/copy the file included in the repository. However, just to 
demonstrate the file that is generated, I have included a default 
version. The values start at 0 and each setting is tracked separately. 
As you gain new high scores for each setting, the .ini will be updated.
